        I have been solving all the project ideas on roadmap.sh, and I am surprised how far I have come from where I started
        Highly recommended!

        Since starting my career in 2021, I have only followed one resource, roadmap.sh, it truly helped me go from 0
        to having a job and changing the financial trajectory of my family.

        I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior developers.
        It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career

        roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it during my university days in 2018.
        Back then, it was just a single repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it has had
        on millions of lives since then
